Exercise 3:
Justify the answers to these queries in Prolog engine.

(a)?- 5 + 2 is 3 + 4.
false. "is" doesn't make operations in both members to evaluate.

(b)?- 5 + 2 = 3 + 4.
false. "=" doesn't make operations in both members to evaluate.

(c) ?- 5 + 2 =:= 3 + 4.
true. "=:=" forces to Prolog to solve operations in members.

(d) ?- 5 + 2 \= 3 + 4.
true. "\=" just searches the unification.
